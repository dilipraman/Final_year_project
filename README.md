# Final_year_project# üö≤ Retrofit Electric TVS XL Moped ‚Äì Eco-Friendly Conversion

This project presents the **design, development, and implementation of a retrofit electric conversion kit** for the iconic *TVS XL moped*. The aim is to enable a seamless and cost-effective transition from internal combustion to electric power, contributing to the rise of sustainable mobility‚Äîespecially in rural and urban settings where two-wheelers are essential.

## üìò Abstract

The retrofit kit is engineered to replace the ICE drivetrain with a BLDC motor and lithium-ion battery pack, requiring minimal modifications to the original vehicle frame. The system offers:
- High torque output
- Optimized weight-to-power ratio
- Simplified charging and power management
- Up to **50 km range per charge**

It serves as a scalable solution for low-cost EV conversion with real-world performance validation using theoretical modeling, simulation, and hardware integration.
